## This webpage shows an animated stick-car.
* This was achieved by utilizing Geometric Algebra, a rarely known branch of mathematics similar to linear algebra.
*  It allowed me to express rotation, translation, and scaling of all vertices of the car simply. Simpler than expressing it with linear algebra.
* The mathematical logic was implemented in JavaScript. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to render the car in a canvas element.
* This project was completed some years before in December 2021, when I was first experimenting with web development to do quirky interesting things.
